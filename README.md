# Microsoft Document Translator
The Microsoft Document Translator translates Microsoft Office, plain text, HTML, PDF files and SRT caption files, from and to any of the 60+ languages supported by the Microsoft Translator web service.
Document Translator uses the customer's own credentials and subscription to perform the Translation. Document Translator can also use custom MT systems trained via the Microsoft Translator Hub (https://microsoft.com/translator/hub.aspx).

## Overview
Translate one or more Office documents, plain text HTML or PDF documents to another language, in one go. 

## Purpose
- Translate an Office document and receive a translated Office document in full fidelity, as an Office document. The translated Office document is fully editable like any normal Office document.
- Translate a text-based PDF document and receive a translated document in Microsoft Word.
- Translate HTML or plain text files and receive translated HTML or plain text.

## Key Features

### Command line operation
Document Translator can be run from the command line:

Translate documents:

`DocumentTranslatorCmd translatedocuments /documents:d:\testdocuments\*.docx /from:en /to:de,el`

*When a wildcard is given, Document Translator recurses through subdirectories.


Set credentials:

`DocumentTranslatorCmd setcredentials /azurekey:AzureKey`

Get Word Alignments

`DocumentTranslatorCmd getalignments /documents:test.txt /from:en /to:fr`

Builds a CSV file containing 3 columns: source, target, and word alignment information in the format 

[[SourceTextStartIndex]:[SourceTextEndIndex]â€“[TgtTextStartIndex]:[TgtTextEndIndex]] *

for every word of the source. The information for each word is separated by a space, including for non-space-separated languages (scripts) like Chinese. 
Example alignment string: "0:0-7:10 1:2-11:20 3:4-0:3 3:4-4:6 5:5-21:21".

In other words, the colon separates start and end index, the dash separates the languages, and space separates the words.
One word may align with zero, one, or multiple words in the other language, and the aligned words may be non-contiguous.
When no alignment information is available, the Alignment element will be empty. No error.
